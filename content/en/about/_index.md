### What exactly is Navidrome?
It is a piece of software that allows you to listen to your own digital music in the same way you 
would with services like Spotify, Apple Music and others. It also allows you to easily share 
your music and playlists with your friends and family

### How it works?
After a simple [installation](/docs/installation), Navidrome indexes all digital music stored in your hard drive and makes
it available through a nice web player and also by using any 
[Subsonic-API compatible mobile client](/docs/overview/#apps). 
Your music becomes searchable and you can create playlists, rate and "favourite" your loved tracks, 
albums and artists
