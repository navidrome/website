Translations are currently managed in [POEditor](https://poeditor.com).
If you want to contribute new translations or help reviewing/proofreading any of the existing 
ones, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xh7j7yF), channel `#translations`, for 
translation efforts coordination and to get further instructions.

## Contributing with a Pull Request

Alternatively, you can submit a pull request with your proposed changes directly [to our project in GitHub](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/tree/master/resources/i18n).

If you choose to contribute translations via a pull request, most of the translation files are located in the [`resources/i18n`](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/tree/master/resources/i18n) directory. The English translation file is the only one located outside of this directory. It can be found in the [`ui/src/i18n/en.json`](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/blob/master/ui/src/i18n/en.json).
