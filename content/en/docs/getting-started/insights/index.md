  Information on how data is collected by the Navidrome project
---

## Overview

Navidrome includes an **anonymous usage statistics feature** designed to help improve the project for all users.
This page explains what data is collected, how it is used, and how to opt out if you prefer not to participate.

---

## Key Principles

- **Anonymous Data Only**: Navidrome collects only non-personal, anonymous data to guide future improvements.
- **What’s Collected**: See [Collected Data](#what-will-be-collected).
- **What’s NOT Collected**: No emails, IP addresses, usernames, or other identifiable data. See [Excluded Data](#what-will-not-be-collected).
- **Opt-Out Available**: Enabled by default, but you can disable it anytime.
- **In-House Data Handling**: Collected data goes to an [open-source server](https://github.com/navidrome/insights) hosted by the project—no third-party services.
- **Full Transparency**: Logs and UI indicators show when data is sent and what it contains.

---

## What Will Be Collected?

Below is a plain-English explanation of what [each field](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/blob/insights/core/metrics/insights/data.go)
is generally intended to represent. Each field corresponds to a piece of information about the running application or its environment:


### Top-level Fields

- **InsightsID:** A unique, **randomly generated** identifier for a given Navidrome instance. It’s a **random** ID that 
  allows reports from the same instance to be grouped together. It is **NOT** directly connected to any of your data,
  and it cannot be used to directly identify you or your instance. 

- **Version:**  Shows which Navidrome version each report came from. In aggregate analysis, this tells you how many users are on a
  particular version and can highlight upgrade patterns.

- **Uptime:** The amount of time an instance has been running. When aggregated, this helps gauge the overall stability and
  average runtime before restarts across the community.

---

### Build Information

Information about custom builds. Aggregated, this can reveal common build configurations used by the community, and if
there are any issues (e.g. performance impact or high memory usage) specific to certain build configurations.

- **Build.Settings:** Key-value pairs representing the compile-time settings for Navidrome (build tags, compiler options, etc.).

- **Build.GoVersion:** The version of Go used to compile Navidrome.

---

### OS Information

- **OS.Type:** Operating system type (e.g., "linux", "windows", "darwin"). When aggregated, this shows the distribution of OS usage.

- **OS.Distro:** OS distribution name for Linux-based systems (e.g., "ubuntu", "debian"). Useful in aggregate form to see which Linux
  distributions are most common.

- **OS.Version:** The version of the operating system or distribution. Aggregating these versions helps track environment trends and
  legacy OS usage.

- **OS.Containerized:** Whether Navidrome is running in a containerized environment (Docker, Kubernetes, etc..) 

- **OS.Arch:** CPU architecture (e.g., "amd64", "arm"). This allows to understand how Navidrome is typically deployed
  (e.g., on Raspberry Pis vs. standard x86 servers).

- **OS.NumCPU:** The number of logical CPUs available. Aggregated, it helps form a picture of typical hardware profiles used across deployments.

---

### Memory Information

Aggregated memory usage helps analyze typical resource consumption patterns and, together with other
metrics, help identify causes for memory leaks.

- **Mem.Alloc:** Current memory allocated by the Go runtime (in bytes).

- **Mem.TotalAlloc:** Memory allocated over the lifetime of the application.

- **Mem.Sys:** Total memory requested from the underlying system.

- **Mem.NumGC:** Number of completed garbage collection runs. Collected in aggregate, this shows a high-level
  overview of how Navidrome manages memory across various deployments.

---

### File System Information

Each FS-related field captures information about the directories or storage mediums used by Navidrome. Aggregating this
data can help understand how frequently different types of storage are configured and where media content is commonly stored.
This information is just the type of the filesystem (ex: nfs, ext4, ntfs...) used for each type of storage,
not the actual path.

- **FS.Music:** File system type for storing music files.

- **FS.Data:** File system type storing Navidrome’s database.

- **FS.Cache:** File system type storing cached data.

- **FS.Backup:** The file system type for backups.

Each of these includes `Type`, describing the kind of storage (e.g., local disk, network mount). Aggregating them
shows how widely different storage setups are used, and their impact on performance.

---

### Library Information

These fields represent aggregate counts of media items and user data within each instance’s library.
Across many deployments, they help illustrate general usage trends of the Navidrome library functionality.

- **Library.Tracks:** Total number of songs (tracks).

- **Library.Albums:** Total number of albums.

- **Library.Artists:** Count of distinct artists.

- **Library.Playlists:** Number of playlists.

- **Library.Shares:** Number of shares (public links).

- **Library.Radios:** The count of radio station entries or streaming sources.

- **Library.ActiveUsers:** Number of currently active users in the last 7 days. This helps understand the average load the server
  is operating under.

- **Library.ActivePlayers:** Number of currently active players in the last 7 days. This allows to understand what 
  are the most used players.

---

### Configuration Settings

These are various Navidrome configuration flags and settings. In aggregate, they help show which features are commonly
enabled or how the service is typically set up across the community. These are mostly boolean flags or simple settings,
**NO** identifiable data is collected (paths, ids, tokens, etc..). For a reference of what each one represents, take a look at
the [configuration options page](/docs/usage/configuration-options#available-options) in the documentation.

- **Config.LogLevel**
- **Config.LogFileConfigured**
- **Config.TLSConfigured**
- **Config.ScanSchedule**
- **Config.TranscodingCacheSize**
- **Config.ImageCacheSize**
- **Config.EnableArtworkPrecache**
- **Config.EnableDownloads**
- **Config.EnableSharing**
- **Config.EnableStarRating**
- **Config.EnableLastFM**
- **Config.EnableListenBrainz**
- **Config.EnableSpotify**
- **Config.EnableMediaFileCoverArt**
- **Config.EnableJukebox**
- **Config.EnablePrometheus**
- **Config.SessionTimeout**
- **Config.SearchFullString**
- **Config.RecentlyAddedByModTime**
- **Config.PreferSortTags**
- **Config.BackupSchedule**
- **Config.BackupCount**
- **Config.DefaultBackgroundURL**
- **Config.DevActivityPanel**
- **Config.EnableCoverAnimation**

**In Summary**:  
When gathered from many Navidrome instances, these metrics and settings are invaluable in understanding the *aggregate*
patterns of usage, deployment environments, media collections, and configuration preferences. This aggregated data
is *not* intended for diagnosing single-instance issues; rather, it provides a high-level view of how Navidrome is
deployed and used by its community overall.

Here's a sample of the data sent: https://gist.github.com/deluan/1c8944fb92329c1658d96bb72a8e8db4

### Data Retention

- Sent daily
- Retained for 30 days, then permanently deleted.

## What Will NOT Be Collected?

To protect your privacy, the following will **not** be collected:

- **No Personal Information**: No emails, usernames, or anything identifiable.
- **No Network Information**: No IP addresses or device fingerprints.
- **No Detailed Playback History**: Individual song plays are not tied to specific users.
- **No Library Details**: Song/artist/album/playlist names are excluded.
- **No Sensitive Configuration Data**: Passwords, tokens, or logs with personal info are never collected.

---

## Why Collect This Data?

Collecting anonymous usage statistics helps:

- Identify popular platforms and configurations.
- Prioritize features and fixes based on usage patterns.
- Ensure updates don’t unintentionally disrupt the majority of users.

## How to Opt-Out

Data collection is **enabled by default**, but you can disable it anytime, by setting the new config option
`EnableInsightsCollector` (or `ND_ENABLEINSIGHTSCOLLECTOR` env var) to `false`. If you have `EnableExternalServices`
set to `false`, it will also disable the insights collection.

Detailed instructions will be provided in the release notes.
