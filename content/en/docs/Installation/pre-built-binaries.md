  Ready to use binaries for all major platforms
---

Just head to the [releases page](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/releases) and download the latest version for you 
platform. There are builds available for Linux (amd64 and arm), Windows (32 and 64 bits) and macOS.

For [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), use the Linux arm builds. Tested with 
[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) Buster on Pi 4

Remember to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in your system, a requirement for Navidrome to work 
properly. You may find the latest static build for your platform here: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ 

If you have any issues with these binaries, or need a binary for a different platform, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/deluan/navidrome/issues) 

### Arch Linux Packages

You can install Navidrome via the
[`navidrome-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/navidrome-bin/) package in
the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). Alternatively, you can install using the
[`navidrome-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/navidrome-git/) package
which will compile Navidrome from source.
