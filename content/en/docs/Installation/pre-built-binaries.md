  Ready to use binaries for all major platforms
---

Just head to the [releases page](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/releases) and download the latest version for your
platform. There are builds available for Linux (Intel and ARM, 32 and 64 bits), Windows (Intel 32 and 64 bits) and macOS (Intel 64 bits).

For [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org), use a suitable Linux ARM build. Tested with 
[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian).

Remember to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in your system, a requirement for Navidrome to work 
properly. You may find the latest static build for your platform here: https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/.

If you have any issues with these binaries, or need a binary for a different platform, please 
[open an issue](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues).

### Arch Linux Packages

You can install Navidrome via the
[`navidrome-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/navidrome-bin/) package in
the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/). Alternatively, you can install using the
[`navidrome-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/navidrome-git/) package
which will compile Navidrome from source.
