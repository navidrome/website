Navidrome can be used as a standalone server, that allows you to browse and listen to your music collection using a web browser. 


It can also work as a lightweight Subsonic-API compatible server, that can be used with any 
[Subsonic compatible client](/docs/overview/#apps).

{{< alert color="warning" title="NOTE" >}}
Navidrome [**does not support**](/docs/faq/#can-you-add-a-browsing-by-folder-optionmode-to-navidrome) 
browsing by folders, but simulates it based on the tags with a structure like: 
`/AlbumArtist/Album/01-Song.ext`
{{</alert>}}

## Road map

This project is in active development. Expect a more polished experience and new features/releases 
on a frequent basis. Some upcoming features planned: 

- [Multiple Artists](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/211)
- [Multiple folders](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/192)
- [UI to edit Smart playlists](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/1417)
- [Jukebox mode](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/364) (plays music on an audio device attached to the server, and control from the UI/Mobile client)
- [Support more tags](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome/issues/1036) (including multi-valued tags)
