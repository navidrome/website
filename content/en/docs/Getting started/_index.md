After [installing](/docs/installation) Navidrome in your platform, you need to create your
first user. This will be your admin user, a super user that can manage all aspects of Navidrome, 
including the ability to manage other users. Just browse to Navidrome's homepage at 
[http://localhost:4533](http://localhost:4533) and you will be greeted with a screen like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

Just fill out the username and password you want to use, confirm the password and click on the 
"Create Admin" button.

That's it! You should now be able to browse and listen to all your music. 

**Note**: It usually take a couple of minutes for 
your music to start appearing in Navidrome's UI. You can check the logs to see what is the scan 
progress. If you see any errors, [reach out](/community) and we can help you
