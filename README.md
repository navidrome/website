## Setting up local environment

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/navidrome/website.git
cd website
npm install
```

You'll need to install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 0.66.0 or newer

Note: For Windows users, you need to be sure to install the extended edition of Hugo.  

This can be done via `choco install hugo-extended`

## Running the website locally

Once you've setup your local environment as above, from the repo's root folder run:

```
hugo server
```

This will start Hugo and serve the site at http://localhost:1313
