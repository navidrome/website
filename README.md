## Running in a container locally

You can run this project inside a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
container. The container runs with a volume bound to the project's source
folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other
than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on
Windows and Mac, and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
on Linux.

1. Build the docker image

   ```bash
   docker compose build
   ```

2. Run the built image

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   > NOTE: You can run both commands at once with `docker compose up --build`.

3. Verify that the service is working.

   Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar.
   This opens a local instance of the project's homepage. You can now make
   changes to the source code, and those changes will immediately show up in your
   browser after you save.

### Cleanup

To stop Docker Compose, on your terminal window, press **Ctrl + C**.

To remove the produced images, run:

```bash
docker compose rm
```
For more information, see the [Docker Compose
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/).

## Setting up local environment

1. Install dependencies:
    - [Go][]
    - [Hugo][] (0.107.0 or newer)
    - [Node.js][]
   
   ### Linux
   #### Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu)
   ```bash
   # Install Go
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install golang-go

   # Install Hugo
   sudo apt install hugo

   # Install Node.js
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

   #### Arch Linux
   ```bash
   # Install Go
   sudo pacman -S go

   # Install Hugo
   sudo pacman -S hugo

   # Install Node.js
   sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
   ```

   ### macOS
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if not already installed
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

   # Install Go
   brew install go

   # Install Hugo (extended version)
   brew install hugo

   # Install Node.js
   brew install node
   ```

   ### Windows
   ```powershell
   # Install Chocolatey (if not already installed)
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

   # Install Go
   choco install golang

   # Install Hugo (extended version)
   choco install hugo-extended

   # Install Node.js
   choco install nodejs
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navidrome/website
   cd website
   ```

3. If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> NOTE: For Windows users, be sure to install the extended edition of Hugo via `choco install hugo-extended`.

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

This will start Hugo and serve the site at [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).
